# Technical Documentation for form.jsx file which is main file of client sides

This document provides an overview of the technical aspects of the Medical Record Form Component. It covers the following topics:

1. **Hooks**
2. **React Component**
3. **API Calls**
4. **Table Implementation**
5. **Audio Control**

## 1. Hooks

The component utilizes React hooks for managing state and side effects:

- `useState`: Manages the state variables for storing form inputs, loading states, and records fetched from the API.
- `useEffect`: Executes side effects such as fetching records from the API and updating component state based on certain conditions.

## 2. React Component

The main component, `Form`, is a functional component responsible for rendering the entire medical record form interface. It includes form inputs for doctor's name, patient's name, patient's age, recording date, and an upload button for audio files. Upon submission, it sends the form data to the server via an API call.

## 3. API Calls

The component interacts with the server through two API functions:

- `addRecord`: Sends a POST request to add a new medical record to the database.
- `getRecord`: Sends a GET request to retrieve existing medical records from the database.

These functions are imported from the `../service/api` module.

## 4. Table Implementation

The component displays the list of medical records in a table format. The table is implemented using styled-components for styling and responsiveness. It includes columns for doctor's name, patient's name, patient's age, recording date, and an audio control column for playing associated audio files.

## 5. Audio Control

Each row in the table includes an audio control element that allows users to play audio recordings associated with each medical record. The audio control is implemented using the `<audio>` HTML element and styled using CSS.
